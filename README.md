#Instructions for running the MakeScanMacros.py and submit.py/sh scripts

Do mkdir build, cd build, cmake .., and then make -j16 (-j# signifies the # of cores you wish to use)

Do mkdir R6ParamScan, mkdir root_files (R6paramScan stores macros generated by MakeScanMacros.py)

Move MakeScanMacros, submit.py/sh and ExtractScanResults.C to the build folder

To run MakeScanMacros.py, do python2.7 filepath/MakeScanMacros.py	

Once the macros are generated, do ./submit.sh. This will submit the macros as jobs to the ifarm

The file names will be copied to files.dat as strings. To read these files and create plots of the PE yields
	do root, .L ExtractScanResults.C and then ExtractScanResults()

ExtractScanResults.C performs a langau fit for each root file. The parameters can be modifed depending on what's needed
